# Transitionz
## Collection of transitions for UIKit

This project was created to demonstrate how to create and use different transition effects.

So far, the transitions available are:
- Slide up/down
- Slide vertically (from and to each corner)
- Push and fade (view is pushed towards user and faded out, while the other view is faded in).

More detailed documentaion and more transitions to come.
